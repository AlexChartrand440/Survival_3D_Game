This is the 3D Survival Game built in Unity3D.

I have created small ground consisting of Grass, Trees and Rocks.
There are two types of enemies : Monsters and Boars.

Player has 6 different weapons to kill enemies.
(1) Axe
(2) Revolver
(3) Shotgun
(4) Rifle
(5) Spear
(6) Bow-Arrow

I have also displayed the health and stamina of the player during the game.
You can see the demo as below.
